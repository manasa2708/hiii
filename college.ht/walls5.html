The Colosseum or Coliseum,is also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; 
Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio, is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of 
travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock) , and brick-faced concrete, it was the largest amphithe
      atre ever built at the time and held 50,000 spectators. The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum.</p></i><br><br>

However, at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote, the masculine nouncoliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre.
The Colossus did eventually fall, possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze. By the year 1000 the name "Colosseum" had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre from the nearby Colossus Solis.[18]The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives, situated between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma.[19]
The name further evolved to Coliseum during the Middle Ages. In Italy, the amphitheatre is still known as il Colosseo, and other Romance languages have come to use similar forms such as Coloseumul(Romanian), le Colisée (French), el Coliseo (Spanish) and o Coliseu (Portuguese).

The site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake/marsh.[20] By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea.[19]

Although the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearb
